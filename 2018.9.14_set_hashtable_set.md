#### Q771.Jewels and Stones

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S`is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

- `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in `J` are distinct.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        """
        :type J: str
        :type S: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        a = set(J)
        for item in S:
            if item in a:
                count += 1
        return count
```

#### Q219.Contains Duplicate II

Given an array of integers and an integer *k*, find out whether there are two distinct indices *i* and *j* in the array such that **nums[i] = nums[j]** and the **absolute** difference between *i* and *j* is at most *k*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        dic = {}
        minVal = float('inf')
        for i in xrange(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in dic:
                dic[nums[i]] = i
            else:
                minVal = min(minVal,i-dic[nums[i]])
                dic[nums[i]] = i
        return minVal <= k
```

#### Q500.Keyboard Row

Given a List of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of **alphabet** on only one row's of American keyboard like the image below.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"]
Output: ["Alaska", "Dad"]
```



**Note:**

1. You may use one character in the keyboard more than once.
2. You may assume the input string will only contain letters of alphabet.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findWords(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        res = []
        a = set("qwertyuiop")
        b = set("asdfghjkl")
        c = set("zxcvbnm")
        for item in words:
            tmp = set(item.lower())
            if tmp & a == tmp:
                res.append(item)
            if tmp & b == tmp:
                res.append(item)
            if tmp & c == tmp:
                res.append(item)
        return res
```
