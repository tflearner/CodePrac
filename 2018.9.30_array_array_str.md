#### Q914.X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards

In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return `true` if and only if you can choose `X >= 2` such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

- Each group has exactly `X` cards.
- All the cards in each group have the same integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2]
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= deck.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= deck[i] < 10000`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck):
        """
        :type deck: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        dic = collections.Counter(deck)
        for i in range(2,len(deck)+1):
            if len(deck) % i == 0:
                if all(v % i == 0 for v in dic.values()):
                    return True
        return False
```

#### Q915.Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

Given an array `A`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:

- Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
- `left` and `right` are non-empty.
- `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the **length** of `left` after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
3. It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition `A` as described.

```python 
class Solution(object):
    def partitionDisjoint(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        maxleft = [0] * len(A)
        minright = [0] * len(A)
        
        maxleft[0] = A[0]
        maxV = A[0]
        for i in range(1,len(A)):
            if A[i] > maxV:
                maxleft[i] = A[i]
                maxV = A[i]
            else:
                maxleft[i] = maxV
        minright[-1] = A[-1]
        minV = A[-1]
        for i in range(len(A)-2,-1,-1):
            if A[i] < minV:
                minV = A[i]
                minright[i] = A[i]
            else:
                minright[i] = minV
        for i in range(0,len(A)-1):
            if maxleft[i] <= minright[i+1]:
                return i+1
```

#### Q916.Word Subsets

We are given two arrays `A` and `B` of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.

Now, say that word `b` is a subset of word `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a`, **including multiplicity**.  For example, `"wrr"` is a subset of `"warrior"`, but is not a subset of `"world"`.

Now say a word `a` from `A` is *universal* if for every `b` in `B`, `b` is a subset of `a`. 

Return a list of all universal words in `A`.  You can return the words in any order.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","oo"]
Output: ["facebook","google"]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["lo","eo"]
Output: ["google","leetcode"]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["ec","oc","ceo"]
Output: ["facebook","leetcode"]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length, B.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= A[i].length, B[i].length <= 10`
3. `A[i]` and `B[i]` consist only of lowercase letters.
4. All words in `A[i]` are unique: there isn't `i != j` with `A[i] == A[j]`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def wordSubsets(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: List[str]
        :type B: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        def count(word):
            ans = [0] * 26
            for item in word:
                ans[ord(item)-ord("a")] += 1
            return ans
        tmp = [0] * 26
        for b in B:
            for i,j in enumerate(count(b)):
                tmp[i] = max(tmp[i],j)
        res = []
        for a in A:
            if all(i >= j for i,j in zip(count(a),tmp)):
                res.append(a)
        return res
```
