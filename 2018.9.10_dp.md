#### Q256.Paint House

There are a row of *n* houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `*n* x *3*` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note:**
All costs are positive integers.

**Example:**

```
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minCost(self, costs):
        """
        :type costs: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not costs:
            return 0
        '''
        dp = [0]*len(costs)
        dp[0] = min(costs[0])
        tmp = costs[0].index(dp[0])
        for i in range(1,len(costs)):
            minVal = float('inf')
            for j in range(3):
                if j == tmp:
                    continue
                else:
                    minVal = min(minVal,costs[i][j])
            dp[i] = minVal
            tmp = costs[i].index(dp[i])
        return dp
        '''
        pre = costs[0][:]
        now = [0]*3
        for i in range(len(costs)-1):
            now[0] = min(pre[1],pre[2]) + costs[i+1][0]
            now[1] = min(pre[0],pre[2]) + costs[i+1][1]
            now[2] = min(pre[0],pre[1]) + costs[i+1][2]
            pre = now[:]
        return min(pre)
