#### Q323.Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1
```

**Note:**
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countComponents(self, n, edges):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type edges: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def dfs(n, g, visited):
            if visited[n]:
                return
            visited[n] = 1
            for x in g[n]:
                dfs(x, g, visited)
                
        visited = [0] * n
        g = {x:[] for x in xrange(n)}
        for x, y in edges:
            g[x].append(y)
            g[y].append(x)
        print g
        ret = 0
        for i in xrange(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                dfs(i, g, visited)
                ret += 1
                
        return ret
```
