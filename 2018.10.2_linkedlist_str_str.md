#### Q143.Reorder List

Given a singly linked list *L*: *L*0→*L*1→…→*L**n*-1→*L*n,
reorder it to: *L*0→*L**n*→*L*1→*L**n*-1→*L*2→*L**n*-2→…

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

**Example 1:**

```
Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
```

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def reorderList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if not head or not head.next or not head.next.next:
            return
        slow,fast = head,head
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        a = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        prev = None
        while a:
            cur = a
            a = a.next
            cur.next = prev
            prev = cur
        cur1,cur2 = head,prev
        while cur2:
            next1,next2 = cur1.next,cur2.next
            cur1.next = cur2
            cur2.next = next1
            cur1,cur2 = next1,next2
```

#### Q211.Add and Search Word - Data structure design

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

```
void addWord(word)
bool search(word)
```

search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters `a-z` or `.`. A `.` means it can represent any one letter.

**Example:**

```
addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true
```

**Note:**
You may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.

```python
class WordDictionary(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.dic = collections.defaultdict(list)
        

    def addWord(self, word):
        """
        Adds a word into the data structure.
        :type word: str
        :rtype: void
        """
        if word:
            self.dic[len(word)].append(word)
        

    def search(self, word):
        """
        Returns if the word is in the data structure. A word could contain the dot character '.' to represent any one letter.
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not word:
            return False
        if "." not in word:
            return word in self.dic[len(word)]
                
        for item in self.dic[len(word)]:
            for i,j in enumerate(word):
                if word[i] != item[i] and word[i] != ".":
                    break
            else:
                return True
        return False

# Your WordDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordDictionary()
# obj.addWord(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
```

#### Q811.Subdomain Visit Count

A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" implicitly.

Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com".

We are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.

```
Example 1:
Input: 
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
Output: 
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
Explanation: 
We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.
Example 2:
Input: 
["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
Output: 
["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]
Explanation: 
We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. For the subdomains, we will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.
```

**Notes:**

- The length of `cpdomains` will not exceed `100`. 
- The length of each domain name will not exceed `100`.
- Each address will have either 1 or 2 "." characters.
- The input count in any count-paired domain will not exceed `10000`.
- The answer output can be returned in any order.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def subdomainVisits(self, cpdomains):
        """
        :type cpdomains: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        dic = {}
        for item in cpdomains:
            a,b = int(item.split()[0]),item.split()[1]
            tmp = b.split(".")
            for i in range(len(tmp)-1,-1,-1):
                if i == len(tmp) -1:
                    cur = tmp[i]
                else:
                    cur = tmp[i] + "." + cur
                if cur in dic:
                    dic[cur] += a
                else:
                    dic[cur] = a
        res = []
        for key,value in dic.items():
            res.append(str(value)+" "+str(key))
        return res
```
