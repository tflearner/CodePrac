#### Q12.Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: C = 100, L = 50, XXX = 30 and III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

        I = ["", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"]
        return M[num//1000] + C[(num%1000)//100] + X[(num%100)//10] + I[(num%10)]

#### 535.Encode and Decode TinyURL

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

```python
import random
import string
class Codec:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dic = {}

    def encode(self, longUrl):
        """Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        
        :type longUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        tmp = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
        tmpstr = "http://tinyurl.com/"+"".join(random.choice(tmp) for _ in range(6))
        self.dic[tmpstr] = longUrl
        return tmpstr
                
        

    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        """Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        
        :type shortUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        return self.dic.get(shortUrl)
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```

#### Q258.Add Digits

Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

**Example:**

```
Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

**Follow up:**
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def addDigits(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        while len(str(num)) > 1:
            tmp = 0
            for item in str(num):
                tmp += int(item)
            num = tmp
        return num
```

```python
this method depends on the truth:

N=(a[0] * 1 + a[1] * 10 + ...a[n] * 10 ^n),and a[0]...a[n] are all between [0,9]

we set M = a[0] + a[1] + ..a[n]

and another truth is that:

1 % 9 = 1

10 % 9 = 1

100 % 9 = 1

so N % 9 = a[0] + a[1] + ..a[n]

means N % 9 = M

so N = M (% 9)

as 9 % 9 = 0,so we can make (n - 1) % 9 + 1 to help us solve the problem when n is 9.as N is 9, ( 9 - 1) % 9 + 1 = 
```

```python
class Solution(object):
def addDigits(self, num):
    """
    :type num: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    if num == 0 : return 0
    else:return (num - 1) % 9 + 1
```
