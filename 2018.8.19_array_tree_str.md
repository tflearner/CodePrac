#### 888.Fair Candy Swap

Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: `A[i]` is the size of the `i`-th bar of candy that Alice has, and `B[j]` is the size of the `j`-th bar of candy that Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy.  (*The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.*)

Return an integer array `ans` where `ans[0]` is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and `ans[1]` is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
Output: [5,4]
```

```python
# sum(A)-a+b == sum(B)-b+a
# a-b = (sum(A)-sum(B))//2
class Solution(object):
    def fairCandySwap(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        dif = (sum(A)-sum(B))//2
        A = set(A)
        for b in set(B):
            if dif +b in A:
                return [dif+b,b]
```

#### 889.Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal

Return any binary tree that matches the given preorder and postorder traversals.

Values in the traversals `pre` and `post` are distinct positive integers.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pre = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], post = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

 ```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def constructFromPrePost(self, pre, post):
        """
        :type pre: List[int]
        :type post: List[int]
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if pre:
            root = TreeNode(pre.pop(0))
            post.pop()
            if pre:
                if pre[0] == post[-1]:
                    root.right = self.constructFromPrePost(pre,post)
                else:
                    l,r = post.index(pre[0]),pre.index(post[-1])
                    root.left = self.constructFromPrePost(pre[:r],post[:l+1])
                    root.right = self.constructFromPrePost(pre[r:],post[l+1:])
            return root
 ```

#### 890.Find and Repalce Pattern

You have a list of `words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which words in `words` matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

(*Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.*)

Return a list of the words in `words` that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words, pattern):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type pattern: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        ans = []
        def helper(word):
            dic = {}
            for i in range(len(word)):
                if word[i] not in dic:
                    dic[word[i]] = ord(word[i]) - ord(pattern[i])
                else:
                    if ord(word[i]) - ord(pattern[i]) == dic[word[i]]:
                        continue
                    else:
                        return None
            dic = {}
            for i in range(len(word)):
                if pattern[i] not in dic:
                    dic[pattern[i]] = ord(word[i]) - ord(pattern[i])
                else:
                    if ord(word[i]) - ord(pattern[i]) == dic[pattern[i]]:
                        continue
                    else:
                        return None
            ans.append(word)
        for word in words:
            helper(word)
        return ans
```
