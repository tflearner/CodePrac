#### Q167.Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        i,j = 0,len(numbers)-1
        while i < j:
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target:
                j -= 1
            elif numbers[i] + numbers[j] < target:
                i += 1
            else:
                return [i+1,j+1]
```

#### Q824.Goat Latin

A sentence `S` is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "*Goat Latin"* (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

- If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append `"ma"` to the end of the word.
  For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
- If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add `"ma"`.
  For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.
- Add one letter `'a'` to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
  For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end and so on.

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from `S` to Goat Latin. 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "I speak Goat Latin"
Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
```

 

Notes:

- `S` contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space between each word.
- `1 <= S.length <= 150`.

 ```python
class Solution(object):
    def toGoatLatin(self, S):
        """
        :type S: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        Check = ['a','e','i','o','u']
        res = ''
        s = 'ma'
        S = S.split(' ')
        for i in range(len(S)):
            s += 'a'
            if S[i][0].lower() in Check:
                tmp = S[i]+s+' '
                res += tmp
            else:
                tmp = S[i][1:]+S[i][0]+s+' '
                res += tmp
        return res[:-1]
 ```
