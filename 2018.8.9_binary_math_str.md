#### Q67.Add Binary

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both **non-empty** and contains only characters `1` or `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

 ```python
class Solution(object):
    def addBinary(self, a, b):
        """
        :type a: str
        :type b: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        x = self.helper(a)
        y = self.helper(b)
        sum = x+y
        res = ""
        while sum//2:
            res += str(sum % 2)
            sum = sum//2
        res += str(sum % 2)
        return res[::-1]
    def helper(self,n):
        sum = 0
        index = 0
        for i in range(len(n)-1,-1,-1):
            sum += int(n[i])*(2**index)
            index+=1
        return sum
 ```

#### Q292.Nim Game

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

**Example:**

```
Input: 4
Output: false 
Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game;
             No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be 
             removed by your friend.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canWinNim(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return False if n % 4 == 0 else True
```

#### Q680.Valid Palindrome II

Given a non-empty string `s`, you may delete **at most** one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "aba"
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```

**Note:**

1. The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def validPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        i,j = 0,len(s)-1
        while i < j:
            if s[i] != s[j]:
                x,y = s[i:j],s[i+1:j+1]
                return x == x[::-1] or y == y[::-1]
            i+=1
            j-=1
        return True
```
