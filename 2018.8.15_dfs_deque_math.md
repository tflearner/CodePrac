#### Q339.Nested List Weight Sum

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.
```

#### Q346.Moving Average from Data Stream

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

**Example:**

```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

```python
class MovingAverage(object):

    def __init__(self, size):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        :type size: int
        """
        self.size = size
        self.queue = collections.deque()

    def next(self, val):
        """
        :type val: int
        :rtype: float
        """
        queue = self.queue
        if len(queue) == self.size:
            queue.popleft()
        queue.append(val)
        return float(sum(queue))/len(queue)
            


# Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MovingAverage(size)
# param_1 = obj.next(val)
```

#### 463.Island Perimeter

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

**Example:**

```
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Answer: 16
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not grid:
            return 0
        def helper(i,j):
            sum = 0
            adjacent = [(i+1,j),(i,j+1),(i-1,j),(i,j-1)]
            for x,y in adjacent:
                if x< 0 or y<0 or x == len(grid) or y == len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 0:
                    sum+=1
            return sum
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    res += helper(i,j)
        return res
```
