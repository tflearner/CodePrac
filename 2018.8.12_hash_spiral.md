#### 888.Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

We are given two sentences `A` and `B`.  (A *sentence* is a string of space separated words.  Each *word* consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is *uncommon* if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order. 


**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

```python
# 写复杂了
# uncommon word = word that only appear once in A and B
class Solution(object):
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: str
        :type B: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        dic = {}
        for a in A.split(' '):
            if a not in dic:
                dic[a] = 1
            else:
                dic[a] += 1
        for b in B.split(' '):
            if b in dic:
                dic[b] = 0
            else:
                dic[b] = 1
        res = []
        for item,value in dic.items():
            if value == 1:
                res.append(item)
        return res
```

#### 889.Spiral Matrix III

On a 2 dimensional grid with `R` rows and `C` columns, we start at `(r0, c0)` facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. 

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.) 

Eventually, we reach all `R * C` spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]
