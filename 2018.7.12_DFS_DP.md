#### Q200.Number of Islands

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(grid) == 0:
            return 0
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    self.DFS(grid,i,j)
                    count += 1
        return count
    def DFS(self,grid,i,j):
        if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] == '0':
            return
        grid[i][j] = '0'
        self.DFS(grid,i+1,j)
        self.DFS(grid,i-1,j)
        self.DFS(grid,i,j+1)
        self.DFS(grid,i,j-1)
```

#### Q198.House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

 ```python
#f(0) = dp[0]
#f(1) = max(dp[0],dp[1])
#f(k) = max(f(k-2)+dp[k],f(k-1))
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:return nums[0]
        if len(nums) == 2:return max(nums)
        val = [0,0,0]
        val[0] = nums[0]
        val[1] = max(nums[0],nums[1])
        for i in range(2,len(nums)):
            val[2] = max(val[0] + nums[i],val[1])
            val[0],val[1] = val[1],val[2]
        return val[2]
 ```
