#### 674.Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
```

**Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        start,ans,tmp = 0,1,1
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[start]:
                tmp += 1
                start += 1
            else:
                start = i
                tmp = 1
            ans = max(tmp,ans)
        return ans
```
