#### Q127.Word Ladder

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**Note:**

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        """
        :type beginWord: str
        :type endWord: str
        :type wordList: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        queue = collections.deque([[beginWord,1]])
        wordList = set(wordList)
        while queue:
            word,length = queue.popleft()
            if word == endWord:
                return length
            for i in range(len(word)):
                for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    newWord = word[:i]+c+word[i+1:]
                    if newWord in wordList:
                        wordList.remove(newWord)
                        queue.append([newWord,length+1])
        return 0
```

#### Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string *s*, partition *s* such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of *s*.

**Example:**

```
Input: "aab"
Output:
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def partition(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        res = []
        self.dfs(s,[],res)
        return res
    
    def dfs(self,s,path,res):
        if not s:
            res.append(path)
        for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
            if self.isPal(s[:i]):
                self.dfs(s[i:],path+[s[:i]],res)
                
    def isPal(self,s):
        return s == s[::-1]
```
