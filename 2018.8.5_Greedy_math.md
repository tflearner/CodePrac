#### Q885.Boats to Save People

The `i`-th person has weight `people[i]`, and each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

**Note**:

- `1 <= people.length <= 50000`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numRescueBoats(self, people, limit):
        """
        :type people: List[int]
        :type limit: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        queue = collections.deque(sorted(people))
        while queue:
            item = queue.pop()
            if queue and item + queue[0] <= limit:
                queue.popleft()
            count+=1
        return count
```

#### Q887.Projection Area of 3D Shapes

On a `N * N` grid, we place some `1 * 1 * 1 `cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of grid cell `(i, j)`.

Now we view the *projection* of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

 





**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[2]]
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21
```

 

**Note:**

- `1 <= grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def projectionArea(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] != 0:
                    res+=1
        
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            res+=max(grid[i])
            
        for i in range(len(grid[0])):
            maxVal = 0
            for j in range(len(grid)):
                maxVal = max(maxVal,grid[j][i])
            res+=maxVal
        return res
```
