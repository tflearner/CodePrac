#### Q56.Merge Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considerred overlapping.
```

```python
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval(object):
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[Interval]
        :rtype: List[Interval]
        """
        if not intervals:
            return []
        res = []
        for i in sorted(intervals,key = lambda x:x.start):
            if res and i.start <= res[-1].end:
                res[-1].end = max(i.end,res[-1].end) 
            else:
                res+=[i]
        return res
```

#### Q62.Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        ans = [[1 for x in range(m)]for x in range(n)]
        for i in range(1,n):
            for j in range(1,m):
                ans[i][j] = ans[i-1][j] + ans[i][j-1]
        return ans [-1][-1]
```

#### Q162.Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array `nums`, where `nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1]`, find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5 
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Note:**

Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

 ```python
class Solution(object):
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        low, high = 0,len(nums)-1
        while low < high:
            mid1 = (low+high)//2
            mid2 =mid1+1
            if nums[mid1] < nums[mid2]:
                low = mid2
            else:
                high = mid1
        return low
 ```
