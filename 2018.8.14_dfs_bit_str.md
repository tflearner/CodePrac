#### 695.Max Area of Island

Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

**Example 1:**

```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

```
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return 0.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def dfs(i,j,grid):
            if 0 <= i <len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j]:
                grid[i][j] = 0
                return 1+ dfs(i+1,j,grid)+dfs(i,j+1,grid)+dfs(i-1,j,grid)+dfs(i,j-1,grid)
            return 0
        area = [dfs(i,j,grid) for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0])) if grid[i][j]]
        return max(area) if area else 0
```

#### Q461.Hamming Distance

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        """
        :type x: int
        :type y: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return len([i for i in bin(x^y) if i == '1'])
```

#### Strobogrammatic Number

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  "69"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  "88"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:  "962"
Output: false
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num):
        """
        :type num: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        i, j =0, len(num)-1
        dic = {'0':'0','1':'1','8':'8','6':'9','9':'6'}
        if not num:
            return False
        while i <= j:
            if num[i] in dic and num[j] in dic:
                if dic[num[i]] == num[j]:
                    i += 1
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
