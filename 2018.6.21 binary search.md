#### 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

##### Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        a,b = 0,x
        while a <= b:
            mid = a + (b-a)//2
            if mid * mid <= x < (mid+1)*(mid+1):
                return mid
            elif x > mid*mid:
                a = mid+1
            else:
                b = mid
```

#### Q21.Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

##### Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i-1]>0:
                nums[i]+=nums[i-1]
        return max(nums)
```
