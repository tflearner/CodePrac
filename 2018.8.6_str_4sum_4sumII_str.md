#### Q884.Decoded String at Index

 An encoded string `S` is given.  To find and write the *decoded* string to a tape, the encoded string is read **one character at a time** and the following steps are taken:

- If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
- If the character read is a digit (say `d`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d-1` more times in total.

Now for some encoded string `S`, and an index `K`, find and return the `K`-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "leet2code3", K = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "ha22", K = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "hahahaha".  The 5th letter is "h".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: S = "a2345678999999999999999", K = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.  The 1st letter is "a".
```

 

**Note:**

1. `2 <= S.length <= 100`
2. `S` will only contain lowercase letters and digits `2` through `9`.
3. `S` starts with a letter.
4. `1 <= K <= 10^9`
5. The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than `2^63` letters.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def decodeAtIndex(self, S, K):
        """
        :type S: str
        :type K: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        size = 0
        for i in S:
            if i.isdigit():
                size*=int(i)
            else:
                size+=1
        for i in reversed(S):
            K %= size
            if K==0 and i.isalpha():
                return i
            if i.isdigit():
                size //= int(i)
            else:
                size-=1
```

#### Q18.4Sum

------

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer `target`, are there elements *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* in `nums` such that *a* + *b* + *c* + *d* = `target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

**Example:**

```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def fourSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        hash = {}
        res = set()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                sum = nums[i]+nums[j]
                if sum not in hash:
                    hash[sum] = [(i,j)]
                else:
                    hash[sum].append((i,j))
        for key in hash:
            value = target -key
            if value in hash:
                list1 = hash[key]
                list2 = hash[value]
                for (a,b) in list1:
                    for (c,d) in list2:
                        if a!=c and a!=d and b!=c and b!=d:
                            res.add(tuple(sorted([nums[a],nums[b],nums[c],nums[d]])))
        return list(res)
```

#### 454.4Sum II

Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples `(i, j, k, l)` there are such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.

**Example:**

```
Input:
A = [ 1, 2]
B = [-2,-1]
C = [-1, 2]
D = [ 0, 2]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def fourSumCount(self, A, B, C, D):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :type C: List[int]
        :type D: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        hash = {}
        for a in A:
            for b in B:
                if a+b not in hash:
                    hash[a+b] = 1
                else:
                    hash[a+b] +=1
        count = 0
        for c in C:
            for d in D:
                if -c-d in hash:
                    count += hash[-c-d]
        return count
```

#### Q58.Length of Last Word

Given a string *s* consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters `' '`, return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

**Note:** A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

**Example:**

```
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        for i in reversed(s):
            if not i.isalpha() and count > 0:
                return count
            elif i.isalpha():
                count+=1
            else:
                continue
        return count
```
