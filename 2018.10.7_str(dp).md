#### Q300.Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:**

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(*n2*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            tmp = 1
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    tmp = max(tmp,dp[j]+1)
            dp[i] = tmp
        return max(dp)
```

```python
class Solution():
	def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
    tails = [0] * len(nums)
    size = 0
    for x in nums:
        i, j = 0, size
        while i != j:
            m = (i + j) / 2
            if tails[m] < x:
                i = m + 1
            else:
                j = m
        tails[i] = x
        size = max(i + 1, size)
    return size
```
