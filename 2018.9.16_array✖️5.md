#### Q905.Sort Array By Parity

Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `A`, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 5000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 5000`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def sortArrayByParity(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        for item in A:
            if item % 2 == 0:
                res.append(item)
        for item in A:
            if item % 2 == 1:
                res.append(item)
        return res
```

#### Q904.Fruit Into Baskets

In a row of trees, the `i`-th tree produces fruit with type `tree[i]`.

You **start at any tree of your choice**, then repeatedly perform the following steps:

1. Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
2. Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.

Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.

You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.

What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= tree.length <= 40000`
2. `0 <= tree[i] < tree.length`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def totalFruit(self, tree):
        """
        :type tree: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(tree) == 1:
            return 1
        maxVal = 0
        tmp1 = tree[0]
        for i in range(len(tree)):
            if tree[i] != tmp1:
                tmp2 = tree[i]
                break
        count,index = 1,0
        for i in range(1,len(tree)):
            if tree[i] == tmp1 or tree[i] == tmp2:
                count += 1
                maxVal = max(maxVal,count)
                if tree[i] != tree[i-1]:
                    index = i
            else:
                count = i-index+1
                index = i
                tmp1 = tree[i-1]
                tmp2 = tree[i]
        return maxVal
```

#### Q561.Array Partition I

Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into **n** pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```



**Note:**

1. **n** is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

```python
class Solution(object):
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(0,len(nums),2):
            count += nums[i]
        return count
```

#### Q16.3Sum Closest

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**

```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = float('inf')
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            left = i+1;right = len(nums)-1
            while left < right:
                if abs(nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] - target) < abs(res - target):
                    res = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] 
                if nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] > target:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left += 1
        return res
```

#### 153.Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < nums[i-1]:
                return nums[i]
        return nums[0]
```
