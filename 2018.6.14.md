#### Q202.Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example: **

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

##### Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        dict = []
        def cal(m):
            count = 0
            while m:
                a = m%10
                count+=a*a
                m = m/10
            return count
        while True:
            n = cal(n)
            if n not in dict:
                dict.append(n)
                if n == 1:
                    return True
            else:
                return False
```
#### Q7.Reverse Integer

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        def cal(m):
            count = 0
            while m:
                n = m%10
                count += n*pow(10,(len(str(m))-1))
                m = m/10
            return count
        if x > 0:
            return cal(x)
        else:
            return -cal(abs(x))
```
