#### Q443.String Compression

Given an array of characters, compress it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a **character** (not int) of length 1.

After you are done **modifying the input array in-place**, return the new length of the array.

 

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

**Note:**

1. All characters have an ASCII value in `[35, 126]`.
2. `1 <= len(chars) <= 1000`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def compress(self, chars):
        """
        :type chars: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(chars) == 1:
            return len(chars)
        res = []
        a = [(chars[0],0)] + [(chars[i],i) for i in range(1,len(chars)) if chars[i] != chars[i-1]] + [(None,len(chars))]
        b = [(j[0],i[1]-j[1]) for (i,j) in zip(a[1:],a)]
        res = reduce(lambda a, b: (a + [b[0]] + (list(str(b[1])) if (b[1] > 1) else [])), b, [])
        #for i,j in b:
        #   res.append(i)
        #    while j:
        #        if j//10 == 0:
        #            print j
        #            res.append(str(j))
        #           break
        #       else:
        #           res.append(str(j//10**len(str(j))-1))
        #           j = j//10
        chars[:len(res)] = res
        return len(res)
```

#### Q380.Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in *average* **O(1)** time.

1. `insert(val)`: Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
2. `remove(val)`: Removes an item val from the set if present.
3. `getRandom`: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned.

**Example:**

```
// Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();

// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);

// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);

// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);

// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);

// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);

// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.
randomSet.getRandom();
```

```python
import random
class RandomizedSet(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.stack = []
        self.dic = {}

    def insert(self, val):
        """
        Inserts a value to the set. Returns true if the set did not already contain the specified element.
        :type val: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if val in self.stack:
            return False
        else:
            self.dic[val] = len(self.stack)
            self.stack.append(val)
            return True

    def remove(self, val):
        """
        Removes a value from the set. Returns true if the set contained the specified element.
        :type val: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if val in self.stack:
            idx,last = self.dic[val],self.stack[-1]
            self.stack[idx],self.dic[last] = last,idx
            self.stack.pop()
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def getRandom(self):
        """
        Get a random element from the set.
        :rtype: int
        """
        index = random.randint(0,len(self.stack)-1)
        return self.stack[index]


# Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RandomizedSet()
# param_1 = obj.insert(val)
# param_2 = obj.remove(val)
# param_3 = obj.getRandom()
```

#### Q289.Game of Life

According to the [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a *board* with *m* by *n* cells, each cell has an initial state *live* (1) or *dead* (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

**Follow up**:

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def gameOfLife(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                board[i][j] = (0,board[i][j])
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                self.helper(board,i,j)
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                board[i][j] = board[i][j][0]
    def helper(self,board,i,j):
        count = 0
        m,n = len(board),len(board[0])
        if 0<=i-1<m and 0<=j-1<n and board[i-1][j-1][1] == 1:count += 1
        if 0<=i-1<m and 0<=j<n and board[i-1][j][1] == 1:count += 1
        if 0<=i-1<m and 0<=j+1<n and board[i-1][j+1][1] == 1:count += 1 
        if 0<=i<m and 0<=j-1<n and board[i][j-1][1] == 1:count += 1
        if 0<=i<m and 0<=j+1<n and board[i][j+1][1] == 1:count += 1
        if 0<=i+1<m and 0<=j-1<n and board[i+1][j-1][1] == 1:count += 1
        if 0<=i+1<m and 0<=j<n and board[i+1][j][1] == 1:count += 1
        if 0<=i+1<m and 0<=j+1<n and board[i+1][j+1][1] == 1:count += 1
        if board[i][j][1] == 1:
            if count == 2 or count == 3:
                board[i][j] = (1,1)
            else:
                board[i][j] = (0,1)
        if board[i][j][1] == 0 and count == 3:
            board[i][j] = (1,0)
```
